Recursive Math Problems

This project contains a set of recursive and non-recursive functions in Java to solve various mathematical problems.

Problem Descriptions

Minimum in Array — Finds the smallest number in an array

Array Average — Calculates the average value of an array.

Prime Number Check — Recursively checks if a number is prime.

Factorial — Computes n! recursively.

Fibonacci Numbers — Finds the n-th Fibonacci number.

Exponentiation — Computes aⁿ recursively.

Array Reversal — Prints an array in reverse order without using an array data structure.

Digit Check in String — Checks if a string consists only of digits.

Binomial Coefficient — Computes C(n, k) recursively.

GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) — Finds the greatest common divisor using Euclidean algorithm.
